# Image Upload Debug Guide

## Current Issue Analysis

Based on your logs, the image upload process is starting but not completing. Here's what's happening:

```
✅ Image selection: Works (67119 bytes read)
✅ Image preview: Fixed (now shows in CircleAvatar)  
❌ Firebase Storage upload: Incomplete (stops after "Starting Firebase Storage upload...")
❌ Firestore URL update: Never happens (profilePhoto remains empty)
```

## Most Likely Cause: Firebase Storage Rules

**The upload is probably being blocked by Firebase Storage security rules.**

### Quick Fix Steps:

1. **Go to Firebase Console**: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/ross-ai-b6809/storage/rules

2. **Update Storage Rules** (replace existing rules):
```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service firebase.storage {
  match /b/{bucket}/o {
    // Temporary rule for testing - allows all authenticated users
    match /{allPaths=**} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}
```

3. **Click "Publish"**

4. **Test again** - you should now see these additional logs:
```
Upload progress: 25.00%
Upload progress: 50.00%
Upload progress: 100.00%
✅ Image upload completed successfully!
📸 Image URL: https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/...
✅ User profile updated with new image URL in Firestore
```

## What I Fixed in Code:

### Enhanced Debug Logging
- Added upload progress tracking
- Added detailed error messages
- Added success/failure indicators with emojis

### Made Upload Blocking
- Changed from non-blocking to blocking during signup
- You'll now get immediate feedback if upload fails
- Signup won't complete until image upload finishes

### Better Error Handling
- Added timeout (2 minutes max)
- Added specific error type detection
- Added progress monitoring

## Other Possible Issues:

### If Storage Rules Don't Fix It:

1. **Check Firebase Storage is enabled**:
   - Go to Firebase Console > Storage
   - Ensure Storage is set up for your project

2. **Check internet connection**:
   - Ensure stable connection during upload

3. **Check file size limits**:
   - Current image: 67KB (well within limits)
   - Firebase Storage allows up to 5GB per file

### If You See Permission Errors:

```javascript
// More restrictive rules for production:
rules_version = '2';
service firebase.storage {
  match /b/{bucket}/o {
    match /profile_images/{userId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null 
        && request.auth.uid == userId
        && resource.size < 5 * 1024 * 1024; // 5MB limit
    }
  }
}
```

## Testing Steps:

1. Update Firebase Storage rules
2. Run `flutter clean && flutter pub get`
3. Run your app
4. Try signup with image
5. Check debug console for new detailed logs
6. Check Firestore database for updated profilePhoto URL

The blob URL (`blob:http://localhost:56924/...`) is normal for web - it's how browsers handle file references before upload.
